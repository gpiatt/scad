## Background

* The puzzle contains ten parts, numberd from one to ten
* A grid is printed on the puzzle pieces
* There are several layouts to form a rectangle from those pieces. 
* Rectangles can also be formed with parts one to seven, one to eight or one to nine.
* There are two special layouts, one with [all pieces](https://github.com/olikraus/scad/blob/master/winston_freer/png/puzzle_start.png) 
 and another layout with [parts one to seven](https://github.com/olikraus/scad/blob/master/winston_freer/png/puzzle_step3.png):
 Both layouts form a perfect 7x9 grid and will fit perfectly into the provided frame.
